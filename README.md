- 👋 Hi, I’m @jamshaid Mustafa the CTO of Ibex Global as well as the CIO of Virtual World Live.
- I have been working in the IT Sector for more than 20 years and while my focus during that time has shifted from a more hands on developmental approach towards managerial tasks I stil enjoy programming and staying relevvant
- 👀 I’m interested in finding work online.
- I can handle any and all kinds of DevOps or Cloud Engineerring queries a potential client may have and I'm happy to offer my services at very reasonable prices.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to fine tune my own LLM which I got from Mixtral while simultaneously trying to wrap my head around the  new Microsoft Dataverse with it's low code concept and the way the entire system of low code works.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that someone wants to build. Infact my organization Virtual World offers a 12 week program where we take a product from ideation all the way to MVP stage before placing them infront of a panel of investors. If the company recieves investment they can continue to work with us but if not all they have to pay for those 12 weeks is $5,000 service fees.
- 📫 The best way to reach me is via email. Directly email me at Jamshaid.vw@gmail.com and I promise you I will respond
